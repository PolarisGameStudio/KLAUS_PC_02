"W1L01-1.10","somebody needs
 to touch this gear"
"W1L01-1.11","wow, who did that?"
"W1L01-1.12","Who touched that?"
"W1L01-1.13","This one needs to be moved"
"W1L01-1.14","Did you move it?"
"W1L01-1.15","again? wow, this is really creepy"

"W1L01-1.20","...seems like
 a CHECHPOINT!"

is not shown in films"
"W1L03-2.03","Where the prince
needs to travel TO SAVE THE GIRL"
"W1L03-2.04","if we were
 in a film"
"W1L03-2.05","this part would 
be a montage"
"W1L03-2.06","By the way..."
"W1L03-2.07","I can't go back"
"W1L03-2.08","The doors where
I come from

"W1L03-2.11","I'm not good
with metaphors"
"W1L03-2.12","But anyways

"W1L04-1.17","as much control"
"W1L04-1.18","as you thought"
"W1L04-1.19","Uff. I'm a marathon man"
"W1L04-2.01","It looks like we are safe"

"W1L04-3.10","FOR OUR 
FREEDOM!"
"W1L04-3.11","sorry..."
"W1L04-3.12","... that was too dramatic"
"W1L04-3.13","I can see the door"
"W1L04-3.14","Inside!"
"W1L05-1.01","No more camera movements"
"W1L05-1.02","THESE TREADMILLS..."
"W1L05-1.03","I NEED A WORKOUT"

BEFORE"
"W1L05-1.09","Now they have heavy machinery"
"W1L05-1.10","THESE GUYS ARE BUILDING SOMETHING"
"W1L05-1.11","let's not forget about 
the woman crying"
"W1L05-1.12","that was creepy"
"W1L05-1.13","We also have some footsteps"
"W1L05-1.14","and a camera moving"
"W1L05-1.15","we need a new clue"
"W1L05-1.16","we need..."
"W1L05-1.17","??!"
"W1L05-1.18","Somebody is trying to stop us!!"
"W1L05-1.19","Was that human?"
"W1L05-2.01","Somebody is watching us"
"W1L05-2.02","??!"
"W1L05-2.03","that was discouraging"
"W1L05-2.04","CAREFUL"
"W1L05-2.05","I KNOW THAT IT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS"
"W1L05-2.06","But I'm the one risking my life"
"W1L05-2.07","Those guys must 
want us out of this"
"W1L05-2.08","We'll not let him"
"W1L05-2.09","Why're we going 
in this direction again?"
"W1L05-2.10","Can I be open with you?"
"W1L05-2.11","I'm scared"
"W1L05-2.12","but we're in this
together, right?"
"W1L05-2.13","Tricky key"
"W1L05-2.14","unlocked"
"W1L05-2.15","How can I always find the door?"
"W1L05-2.16","We're so lucky in that"
"W1L05-2.17","There's no dead end"
"W1L05-2.18","This guy will know about us"
"W1L05-2.19","You will see"
"W1L05-2.20","You have a good eye!"
"W1L05-2.21","Right, getting out of here
and discover the truth"
"W1L05-2.22","That can't wait, right?"
"W1L05-2.23","I thought so"
"W1L05-3.01","We're going down"
"W1L05-3.02","I mean, we're literally
underground"
"W1L05-3.03","Maybe the footsteps 
are another tape"
"W1L05-3.04","yeah. Probably it's fake and we're worrying for nothing"
"W1L05-3.05","!!"
"W1L05-3.06","Is it mocking us?"
"W1L06-1.01","That was a horrible sound"
"W1L06-1.02","!!"
"W1L06-1.03","So we're not fighting a man"
"W1L06-1.04","we're fighting a beast"
"W1L06-1.05","\"We\" it's a big word

"W1L06-1.06","C'mon, let's go"
"W1L06-1.07","It's big"
"W1L06-1.08","I mean, for me"
"W1L06-1.09","At least you have your superpowers
to change the world"
"W1L06-1.10","I feel LIKE I'M MOVING WITHOUT WILL"
"W1L06-1.11","But this isn't bad"
"W1L06-1.12","I just have to 
reach the next door 
and that's it"
"W1L06-1.13","The big boss
makes the decisions"
"W1L06-1.14","or was it a snake?"
"W1L06-1.15","That shadow was 
so colossal"
"W1L06-1.16","You get it?"
"W1L06-1.17","that we have each other"
"W1L06-1.18","Anyways, the fact is"
"W1L06-1.19","we're a team"
"W1L06-1.20","IT'S THERE!"
"W1L06-1.21","We got it"
"W1L06-1.22","It's gone!"
"W1L06-1.23","Where could it be?"
"W1L06-2.01","One step closer to the truth"
"W1L06-2.02","WOOOOOW!"
"W1L06-2.03","This is like a rollercoaster"
"W1L06-2.04","With the exception that..."
"W1L06-2.05","If I fall. Something will kill me"
"W1L06-2.06","!!"
"W1L06-2.07","This guy continues"
"W1L06-2.08","This seems like his kingdom"
"W1L06-2.09","He knows how to move in here"
"W1L06-2.10","this is going
to hurt"
"W1L06-2.11","Almost there"
"W1L06-2.12","That was
close!"
"W1L06-2.13","He's not going to escape
from us"
"W1L06-3.01","Precaution"
"W1L06-3.02","!!"
"W1L06-3.020","I'm ready!"
"W1L06-3.03","This is his kingdom"
"W1L06-3.04","He'll not be pleased"
"W1L06-3.05","if he catches us"
"W1L06-3.06","We have to play it smart"
"W1L06-3.07","gotcha!"
"W1L06-3.08","I'm allergic to death"
"W1L06-3.09","How does this guy live in this dump?"
"W1L06-3.10","you might not know"
"W1L06-3.11","but the smell is horrible"
"W1L06-3.12","I SEE HIM!!"
"W1L06-3.13","This guy continues"
"W1L06-3.14","HEY, YOU!"
"W1L06-3.15","Don't move"
